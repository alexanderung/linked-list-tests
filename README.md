# Linked List Tests

Basic JUnit tests for COMP 390 A4. Add the `LinkedListTest.java` file to your project and you should be able to run the tests. Eclipse should be able to suggest the **JUnit5** library for you to add.

## Contributing
You are free to fork & make pull requests to this reposity. Your code should be well formatted and documented if necessary. Do not depend on any external libraries that are not already present. Your tests will be reviewed and checked against the solution for correctness. If your tests don't cover anything new or are repetive they will be denied. Ensure that you only commit files that are necssary (do not commit IDE settings files or any of your assignment work). For adding new test cases it would be best to make new files instead of just adding onto the starter file. Try to follow the [single responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) in your test cases (and in general).
